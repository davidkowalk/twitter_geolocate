# Twitter Geolocate
Twitter Geolocation is a console app that generates twitter search querries for a certain geolocation and opens them in your standard webbrowser. Provide either GPS Coordinates, a What3Words-address (requires a free account) or use the mapquest API to search for a location (requires a free account).

## Usage

As a python script this does not need to be installed but to run it you will require python 3.7 or higher and the following packages:

- requests
- json*
- webbrowser*

\* = should be provided with python3

## Search by coordinates

```
$ python3 geolocate.py -c <latitude> <longitude> <radius>
```

Example:
```
$ python3 geolocate.py -c 52.5186202 13.3761872 0.2km
```

## Search by What3Words address.

To use the "What3Words" api you will ned an api key provided with a free account which will grant you 1000 requests per month.

You can read more here: https://developer.what3words.com/public-api

Once you have an api key you can use it to search to convert a querry to coordinates.

```
$ python3 geolocate.py -w <key> <querry> <radius>
```

The three-word-address will automatically be converted to the corresponding coordinates on the southwest corner of the square.

If no key is provided in the console the script will look for a file `wordkey.txt` in the current folder and read the first line of that file as a key. If no file is found it will throw an error.

```
$ python3 geolocate.py -w <querry> <radius>
```

Example:
```
$ python3 geolocate.py -w myKey cover.crumble.hint 0.3km
$ python3 geolocate.py -w cover.crumble.hint 0.3km
```

## Search addresses with mapquest

To use the mapquest api you will need an api key provided with a free account which will grant you 15000 requests per month (which are about 20 per hour if you use the service 24 hours per day)

You can read more here: https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/

Once you have an api key you can use it to search for places.

```
$ python3 gelocate.py -q <key> <querry> <radius>
```

The program will then ask you to select one of the top 5 search results. If only one result is found it will be automatically selected.

Example:
```
$ python3 geolocate.py -q myKey "Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin" 0.3km
Search Results:

(1) KÃ¤fer Dachgarten-Restaurant im Deutschen Bundestag, 1, Platz der Republik, Tiergarten, Mitte, Berlin, 11011, Deutschland
(2) Deutscher Bundestag, 1, Platz der Republik, Tiergarten, Mitte, Berlin, 11011, Deutschland

Please select an option or type "exit" to exit

```

If no key is provided in the console the script will look for a file `mapkey.txt` in the same folder and read the first line of that file as a key. If no file is found it will throw an error.

```
$ python3 geolocate.py -q <querry> <radius>
```
